# PROG 2700 - Assignment

## Make an API call

Using the list of publicly available APIs listed at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis, write a script that retrieves some data from one of the listed public APIs of your choosing and displays it on an html page using the document.write command which writes to the Browser's DOM.

Things to consider:

* Restrict your API choice to ones whose Auth type is listed as either `No` or `apiKey`. 
* Refrain from selecting an API requiring `OAuth` authentication.
* If you choose an API that requires an API Key, it is likely that you'll have to register with the API provider in order to get a key to use. If this proves difficult to figure out, choose a different API with `No` as the Auth Type value.
* Restrict your API choice to ones whose `CORS` value is not `No`.

Be sure that the data that is returned contains the following
* At least two levels of data, and within the second level of data there should be either another JSON object or an array. Be sure to display data from all levels of data returned from the API call. You'll have to research and read up on the available documentation for the APIs you choose to see if it will meet that requirement.
* You cannot choose an API that was already used in class lectures and demonstrations.
* You cannot choose the Deck of Cards API as that will be used in Part C of this assignment.

## Assessment

1.	Don’t forget that a student-led demonstration of your code is part of this assignment. This demonstration will be done either live with the instructor or submitted as a video walkthough. Part of the assessment will include your ability to speak about the code you wrote, even if it doesn’t completely work or do what you expect.
2. Late submissions will be subject to the late penalties laid out in the course outline.

## Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

Code sharing by any means is considered plagiarism and is strictly forbidden under the NSCC Academic Integrity policy.
